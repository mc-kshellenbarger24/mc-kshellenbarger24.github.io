It also allows you to simulate what VR is like but allows you to have full control and you will be in control of your avatar with only your mind.</p>

                    <p id = "Info5Text">Due to legal constraints, the chip implant has to be under a certain size. We were unable to fit any wireless connection component to the current version of The Matrix. In the future, it may be possible to fit smaller and more powerful technology inside the chip to have connectivity.</p>
