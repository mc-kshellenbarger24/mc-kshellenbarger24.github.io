                <p id = "Info1Text">In order to compete with multiple tech companies, we have partnered with Neuralink. The combination of our skills, technology, and resources has created the next and best generation of Virtual Reality.
                Our partnership with Neuralink gives us access to Elon Musk’s other resources such as SpaceX and Tesla allowing us to design the most realistic simulations yet. Having access to Tesla’s vehicles and AI will give us more information to help simulate racing games in The Matrix. Along with Tesla and SpaceX, we will allow us to capture video and physical attributes of our solar system, so we will be able to give you the most realistic outer space training and games.

                <p id = "Info2Text">Our console is made for anyone who wants to have a good time in the virtual world of The Matrix.
                Aside from being a gaming platform, The Matrix can also have custom-created simulations designed for training. As previously mentioned, the partnerships with companies managed by Elon Musk allow us to have more data for creating our simulations. With advanced realism in these simulations, people who want to work in dangerous professions can safely train in The Matrix without the risk of injury or fatal incidents.
